# App Icon Generation Prompt for GPT/DALL-E

## App Description
This is a Rubik's Cube solver app for iOS and Android. The app helps users solve 3x3 Rubik's cubes by:
- Displaying the cube state in 2D (unfolded net) and 3D views
- Providing step-by-step solution algorithms
- Allowing manual cube input for real-world cubes
- Supporting multiple languages (with Hong Kong Chinese as default)

## Icon Requirements

**Style:**
- Modern, minimalist, and clean design
- Professional and polished appearance
- Should work well on both light and dark backgrounds
- Icon should be recognizable at small sizes (app icon scale)

**Visual Elements:**
- Feature a Rubik's Cube (3x3) as the main subject
- Incorporate a sense of "solving" or "solution" - could include:
  - A solved or partially solved cube
  - Subtle visual cues suggesting algorithms/solving (geometric patterns, arrows, or mathematical symbols)
  - A checkmark or completion indicator
- Use vibrant, distinct colors representing the 6 faces of a Rubik's Cube:
  - White, Yellow, Red, Orange, Green, Blue
- Consider showing the cube in an isometric or 3D perspective to emphasize the 3D nature

**Color Scheme:**
- Primary background: Dark (#121212) or transparent
- Cube colors should be bright and saturated for visibility
- Consider a subtle gradient or depth effect
- Ensure good contrast for app icon visibility

**Technical Specifications:**
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Size: 1024x1024 pixels (square)
- Safe zone: Keep important elements within the center 80% to avoid iOS/Android icon mask cropping
- No text or words in the icon
- Simple enough to be recognizable at 20x20 pixels

**Design Direction:**
- Option 1: A 3D isometric Rubik's Cube that's partially solved, with one face completely solved (all one color), suggesting progress and solution
- Option 2: A Rubik's Cube with subtle geometric patterns or grid lines suggesting algorithms and solving steps
- Option 3: A stylized Rubik's Cube with a checkmark or completion symbol integrated subtly
- Option 4: A Rubik's Cube with a subtle "solved" glow or highlight effect

**Avoid:**
- Overly complex details that won't scale down well
- Text or numbers
- Cluttered compositions
- Too many colors competing for attention

**Mood:**
- Professional yet approachable
- Suggests precision, logic, and problem-solving
- Modern tech aesthetic
- Clean and minimal

## Prompt for Image Generation:

"Create a modern, minimalist app icon for a Rubik's Cube solver application. The icon should feature a 3x3 Rubik's Cube rendered in an isometric 3D perspective. The cube should appear partially solved with one face completely uniform (all one color), suggesting progress and solution. Use vibrant, saturated colors for the cube faces (white, yellow, red, orange, green, blue) with distinct borders between stickers. The design should be clean and geometric, with subtle depth and lighting. Include a very subtle suggestion of solving or completion - perhaps a soft glow or highlight on the solved face. The background should be transparent or a dark color (#121212). The overall style should be modern, professional, and recognizable at small sizes. No text, numbers, or complex details. Keep it simple and iconic."
